# XIV Plugins

XIVPlugins is a site that aggregates Dalamud custom repositories and plugins. Please note that these plugin lists are dynamically generated and are **not vetted**. They may contain malware or pose a risk to your account. Use them at your own risk, and ensure you fully understand what you are installing.

**Important**: If you choose to install plugins from custom repositories, **DO NOT** ask for support on the XIVLauncher Discord. Instead, refer to the plugin's README on GitHub, which typically includes support instructions or links to the plugin's Discord server.

## My Custom Repo Is Missing or Contains Incorrect Data

If your custom repository is missing or the information appears incorrect, you can:
1. Add or update the entry in the `config.json` file and submit a pull request (PR). This is the preferred method and will result in faster updates.
2. Alternatively, raise an issue on GitHub. While issues are acceptable, PRs are preferred for quicker resolution.

You should also check the `errors.json` file for any issues with your repository that may have caused it to be skipped during aggregation.
